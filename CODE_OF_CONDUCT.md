# St Mary Gate Project Code of Conduct

Welcome to the St Mary Gate project! We are committed to fostering an open and inclusive community where everyone feels welcome to contribute. As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to make participation a positive and harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the St Mary Gate project, pledge to make participation in our community a positive and harassment-free experience for everyone. We embrace diversity and inclusivity, welcoming individuals regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We strive to foster a community that is open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy. Examples of behavior that contribute to this positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Providing and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility, apologizing for mistakes, and learning from experiences
- Focusing on the overall community's well-being, not just individual interests

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, and any form of sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any conduct that could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are entrusted with clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Reasons for moderation decisions will be communicated when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and when individuals officially represent the community in public spaces. Representing our community includes using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [contact@stmarygate.com](mailto:contact@stmarygate.com). All complaints will be promptly and fairly reviewed and investigated.
